# Rent-Dogs-WebSite
FrontEnd Technologies - React | Typescript

BackEnd Technologies - Node.js (express) | MongoDB (mongoose) 

A website in which the user can rent out dogs for a number of days and enjoy his/her companionship <3

For learning purposes. 

# How To Run The Application 
In the frontend folder, in the terminal, enter the following command: npm run dev

In the backend folder,in a different terminal instance, enter the following command: npm start

P.S This was the first website that I built using React and Typescript. I built this as a project to learn React and Typescript before applying to a job that I knew required this tech stack. And then I got my first ever job.
